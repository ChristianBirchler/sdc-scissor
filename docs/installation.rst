Installation
============
The tool can either be run locally using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ (**RECOMMENDED**) or with
`Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.

When running the simulations a working installation of `BeamNG.tech <https://beamng.tech>`_ is required.
Additionally, this simulation cannot be run in a Docker container but must run locally.

To install the SDC-Scissor, use one of the following approaches:

* Docker: ``docker build --tag sdc-scissor .``
* Poetry: ``poetry install``
